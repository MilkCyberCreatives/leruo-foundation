              Leruo Foundation proudly announces the launch of the Women CEOs' Breakfast Network.
              This exclusive initiative is designed for dynamic women CEOs and founders who are
              leading established businesses with a minimum of two years in operation and at least
              five permanent employees.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Membership is highly selective, based on proven leadership, industry impact, and a
              strong alignment with the Foundationâ€™s mission to empower women in leadership. To
              maintain a space of deep engagement and high-value connection, the network will be
              limited to just 10 participants.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              By joining, you commit not only to growing your own leadership capacity but also to
              contributing to the success of fellow women entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The launch event will be held on <strong>Saturday, 9 August 2025</strong>. Join us
